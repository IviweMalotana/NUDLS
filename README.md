# NUDLS

## a. How to setup code and run
### Unzip folder (NUDLS.zip) and open with VS code
### Press F5 to run

## b. Briefly explain how you approached the problem
### i. What you would do differently if you had to do it again
#### Focus more on the UI initially and ask about the maintenance start date to calculate every 30 days from that start date. I assume it would be 1 Jan 2023, but there were 2022 dates in the dataset too.

### ii. What you learned during the project
###### That my javascript is very rusty. It's not the language I am most confident in, but thanks to Google and other language experience, I could give it a shot. 
###### I need to improve my knowledge and ability to use recursion and algorithms for better programming. 

### iii. How do you think we can improve this challenge
###### The maintenance part confused me. I'm not sure what the start date should be and should've asked.
